        <p> Two kinds of programming languages are <em>compiled</em>
            and <em>scripting</em>.  Compiled language code is first 
            processed by a compiler, which produces an executable for you
            to run.  Scripting language code is still compiled first,
            but it is compiled "on the fly", and is immediately run
            for you.
